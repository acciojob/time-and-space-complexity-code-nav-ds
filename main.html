  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that helps evaluate how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to run. A more efficient algorithm will have a lower time complexity.

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. For example, an algorithm with space complexity of O(n) uses memory that scales linearly with the input size.
